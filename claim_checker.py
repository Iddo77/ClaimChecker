    Your task is to verify that a claim referring to a paper is actually grounded in the paper.

    You are given:
    1. The full PAPER TEXT (between the FIRST set of triple percent signs, %%%).
    2. A CITATION referring to that paper.
    3. A PARAGRAPH that contains a claim referencing that citation.

    IMPORTANT:
    - ONLY extract a quote from the PAPER TEXT.
    - DO NOT quote from the paragraph containing the claim.
    - Your quote will be checked by an automated string search on the PAPER TEXT. If it is not found there, your answer will be rejected.
    - If you cannot find any quote in the paper that supports the claim, respond with a valid quote from the paper that is MOST LIKELY related, and mark the confidence as "LOW".
    - If you mistakenly return text from the paragraph containing the claim, your response will be invalid.
    - The paper may contain mid-sentence interruptions by headers or layout artifacts, because the PDF was parsed to plain text. When quoting such a sentence or paragraph, you must include the erroneous text exactly as it appears. Do not fix or remove layout errors â€” if your quote does not match the paper verbatim, it will be rejected by exact-match checking.

    PAPER TEXT (between %%%):
    %%%
    {paper_txt}
    %%%

    CITATION referring to this paper: 
    {citation}

    PARAGRAPH containing the claim (between %%%):
    %%%
    {paragraph}
    %%%

    Return the EXACT sentence or paragraph from the PAPER TEXT that best substantiates the claim made about it in the paragraph.

    Your output must be valid JSON in the following format:
